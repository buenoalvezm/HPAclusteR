\item{obs}{Gene metadata data frame (must contain a column matching gene IDs)}

\item{var}{Sample metadata data frame (must contain a column matching sample IDs)}

\item{obs_names_col}{Name of the column in gene metadata to use as gene IDs (default: "ensembl_id")}

\value{
AnnDatR object with genes as samples, ready for clustering
}
\description{
\code{hc_initialize()} takes three data frames: an expression matrix, gene metadata, and sample metadata.
The expression matrix must have genes as rows and samples as columns, with the first column as gene IDs.
The gene metadata (\code{obs}) must have a column matching the gene IDs in the expression matrix.
The sample metadata (\code{var}) must have a column matching the sample IDs (column names) in the expression matrix.
